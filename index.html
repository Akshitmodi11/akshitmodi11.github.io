                        <h4>Health Monitoring System Using IoT (Bachelor-Capstone Project)</h4>
                        <p>Arduino  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; January 2021-May 2021 </p>
                        <p>Enabled real-time remote monitoring of vital physiological parameters, improving accessibility to live health data for providers during COVID-19.
                         Designed and developed an IoT-based system to track ECG, pulse, SPO2, and temperature, ensuring seamless data transmission.
                         Integrated AD8232, MAX30100, and DS18B20 sensors with NodeMCU ESP8266, utilizing cloud-based third-party platforms for real-time accessibility.<p>

                        <h4>Posture detection  </h4>
                        <p>Collected IMU sensor data (LSM 9DS1) using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board to detect and classify various body positions
                          (supine, prone, left side, and right side). The data was stored in CSV files for efficient processing and analysis.
                         Preprocessed the collected data and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on it, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy
                          in body position classification. The trained model was then converted and saved as a header file (.h) to facilitate its deployment on
                          the embedded system.
                         Deployed the trained CNN model onto the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board, enabling real-time body position detection. The model
                          leverages machine learning to classify positions based on live sensor data from the IMU, ensuring accurate posture detection in a
                          resource-constrained embedded environment</p>
